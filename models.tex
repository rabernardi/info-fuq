\paragraph{Confirm-it} Encoder-Decoder-plus-Guesser, with an internal
Oracle that at inference time helps the QGen to generate the question
that confirms its hypothesis (the cadidate with highest probability at
the previous turn). 

\paragraph{Rational} Encoder-Decoder-plus-Guesser, with an internal
Oracle that at inference time helps the QGEn to optimally divide the
hypothetical space. 

For both models we develop the version that incorporate the
problem-solving strategy during the training phase exploiting
continual learning losses.


%\rb{For the Guesser, can we use Amazon's guesser? }
