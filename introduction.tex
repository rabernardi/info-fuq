\tb{Success in NLG.}

\tb{NLG for a purpose/problem solving.}

\tb{Our aim: to tie Reasoning and NLG. Method: Link NLG at step $t$ to the model
  uncertanity at step $t_1$}


\tb{Case study: ask a clarification question to detect, from a set of potential entity already
  identified by an anaphora resolution system, the
 correct entity to which an anaphor refer }

\tb{Case study: situated context: ask the question that optiamlly
  divide the hypothesis space given a) a set of visually represented
  entities vs. b) given a set of visually represented entities and a
  dialogy history which has already zoom into a subset of such space}


\tb{Method: contrastive learning not to compare single entities but
  groups of entities.}
